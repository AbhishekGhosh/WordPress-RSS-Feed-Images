WordPress RSS Feed Images
=========================

Add Post Thumbnail Images to RSS Feed

This is just a simple plugin that will pull featured image thumbnails into your WordPress RSS feed.

## Usage

Instead of using as a plugin you can copy the code from `wordpress-rss-feed-images.php` into your `functions.php`

This plugin will also work as a must-use plugin by uploading `wordpress-rss-feed-images.php` to `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`
